cmarverse package developers should strive to meet most guidelines in [The tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) by Hadley Wickham.

It is not necessary to remember every detail of this guide as you write code. Tools like the [styler package](https://github.com/r-lib/styler) (e.g., `styler::style_pkg()`) can be used periodically to automatically reformat code according to the guidelines.

To help with collaboration, we recommend trying to follow the guide when possible. Key guidelines are listed below.
